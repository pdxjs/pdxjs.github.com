# Portland JavaScript Admirers

The Portland JavaScript Admirers group (PDXjs) is a monthly meetup for all things JavaScript-related (browser, Node.js, etc.).

Check out our [Meetup page][1] for details on when and where. You can also follow [our Twitter account][4].

New members are always welcome, no need to RSVP. If you are interested in giving a talk, please email <nobody@example.com>.

We also have a [Slack community][2] you can join to chat with fellow JavaScript admirers. If you would like an invite, please [fill out this Google Form][3] and one of our organizers will send out an invite as soon as possible.
