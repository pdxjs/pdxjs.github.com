# Portland JavaScript Admirers

## Code of Conduct

Every single person at the PDXjs meetup is required to follow this code of conduct.

### Short Version

PDXjs is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Meetup participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup at the discretion of the meetup organizers.

### Long Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of meetup staff immediately. Meetup staff are listed on [pdxjs.com][1], the meetup.com page, and will be identified at the beginning of the event.

Meetup staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all meetup venues and meetup-related social events.

This Code of Conduct is based on the [JSConf Code of Conduct][2].
